### Key Features

1- Large base area to allow enough space for sensors, a micro-controller, a single-board computer, a camera and other parts to be easily installed and moved around.<br>
2- Hardware is not screwed down to allow for easy removal or re-positioning.<br>
3- Jumper cables used and breadboard attached to allow for easy connections.<br>
4- Two motors instead of 4 so the batteries last longer.<br>
