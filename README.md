## Serenity7 - Robotics Experiments
This repo contains my experiments  with Serenity7 - a simple homemade robot.

In each experiment folder you will find the Arduino and/or Python code, a wiring diagram and other relevant files. Each folder also has a readme with a short writeup.

### Key Features of Serenity7

1- Large base area (297mm x 210mm x 3mm thick MDF) to allow enough space for sensors, a micro-controller, a single-board computer, a camera and other parts to be easily installed and moved around.<br>
2- Hardware is not screwed down to allow for easy removal or re-positioning. The motors and castor wheel are attached with double sided tape. The electronics are attached to the base with Prestick.<br>
3- Jumper cables used and breadboard attached to allow for easy connections.<br>
4- Two motors instead of four so the batteries last longer.<br>

### Robotics Resources

All this robotics and electronics stuff may sound complicated but, believe me, it isnt hard to learn. This is a list of resources to help you get started:<br>
