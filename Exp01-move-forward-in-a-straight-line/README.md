## Exp01 - Move forward in a straight line

(Writeup in progress)

Use PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) to vary the speed of each wheel so that the robot moves forward in a fairly straight line instead of drifting left or right.



### Summary

A robot may drift to the right or left when moving forward. This can be caused by:
1- The motors and gears are not identical and therefore turn at different speeds,
2- The castor wheel 
3- Wheels are not identical,
4- other factors

The way to fix this is to increase or reduce the speed of each motor separately. A motor's speed can be adjusted by increasing or reducing the voltage that it receives. PWM is a way to reduce the supply voltage without using a resistor. In this experiment I've used PWM in the Arduino code.
