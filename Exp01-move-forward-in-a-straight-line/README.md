## Exp01 - Move forward in a straight line

### Objective

Use PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) to vary the speed of each wheel so that the robot moves forward in a fairly straight line instead of drifting left or right.

### Notes

The motor speed can be adjusted by increasing or reducing the voltage that it receives. PWM is a way to reduce the supply voltage without using a resistor.
