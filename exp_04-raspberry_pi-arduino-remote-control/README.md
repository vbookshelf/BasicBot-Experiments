### Objectives

1- Remotely control the robot's movement over wifi - by pressing the arrow keys on a computer keyboard.<br>
2- Learn how to use a Raspberry Pi together with an Arduino.


### Summary
The Raspberry Pi runs the Python code and acts as the compute module. The Arduino runs a sketch and acts as the control module for the motors and the distance sensor. The first step is to connect to the Raspberry Pi from a computer, using the VNC virtual desktop. Both the computer and Raspberry Pi need to be on the same wifi network. Using the remote desktop, launch the Python code. Then press the arrow keys on the computer keyboard to move the robot. If the disatnce sensor detects an obstacle less than or equal to 20cm away, the robot will automatically stop moving forward.
