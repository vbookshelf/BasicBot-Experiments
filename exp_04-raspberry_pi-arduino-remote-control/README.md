### Objectives

1- Remotely control the robot's movement over wifi - by pressing the arrow keys on a computer keyboard.<br>
2- Learn how to use a Raspberry Pi together with an Arduino. The Raspberry Pi runs the Python code and acts as the compute module. The Arduino runs a sketch and acts as the control module for the motors and the distance sensor.
