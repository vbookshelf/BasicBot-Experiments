### Objective

Learn how to use the HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor for collision avoidance.

### Examples

- This Arduino sketch demonstrates basic obstacle avoidance. The robot moves forward. When it detects an obstacle it keeps turning left until no obstacle is detected. Then it moves forward.

- This Arduino sketch shows how to use your hand to push the robot back and pull it forward without touching it.



### Lessons Learned
- If the robot approaches a wall at a shallow angle (less than 45 degrees), the sound will not be reflected back to the sensor. Because of this the robot will collide with the wall.

- This sensor has many other applications. For example, it could be used as part of a touchless hand sanitizer dispenser. When the sensor detects the hand close to the bottle, a servo motor arm presses on the bottle to release the sanitizing fluid.
